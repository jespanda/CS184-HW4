      Our main goal in this assignment is to create a room scene, with a bed, a table, a chair, a bookshelf, some books (created on Maya),
 a window (with a light source passing through it (sunlight)), a door and two animated features: the first one is a fish bowl, 
 that will be a transparent cube with water and an animated fish (hand drawn) inside it; the second one is a disco ball, that, when
 the user goes next to a switch, that will be placed in the wall, and press the 'k' key, it will go down the roof and start spinning, emitting
 a bright light. After that, if we have time, we will do another rooms, trying to create a house (and get extra credit).
      </p>
      <p>
 In the technical aspects, we will use a shader in the bed (blanket), in the window (landscape); we will also have two animated
 objects (fish and disco ball); one hand drawn object (fish); one Maya object, created by us (books), that will be instantiated
 a lot of times; the user will have control of the camera and will be able to turn on and off the disco ball; the interesting light effect that we
 will try to implement is the toon shading, in the fish.
      </p>
      <p>
So far, we have designed most part of the room's objects and put them in the desired place, using a scene file. We implemented some more lights, to help us visualize the entire scene. The camera movements are still the same as in HW2, from which we are using the skeleton.
