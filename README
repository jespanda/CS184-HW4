Minimum requirements
===================================================
Object created by hand:
    The cup on the table
Object loaded from a suitable format: 
    We have included a book.obj and fish.obj

All placement and scaling by hand: 
    In hw4drawing.txt, we specify where each object is supposed to go
Two objects must be textured with a suitable image: 
    We were unable to get texturing to work
One shiny object:
    Mattress, doorknob
One dull object:
    book and chair
One directional light:
    On the top and two coming from the disco ball
One object instantiated more than once: 
    We have multiple books
At least half of the objects must have correct normals: 
    True
Double buffering:
    I think we used this
Hidden surface elimination:
    True
Perspective projection: 
    Able to move around the scene
Mechanism for getting rid of textures: 
    Unable to get texture to work so we were unable to implement this

Capabilities:
---------------------------------------------------
Allow the viewer to move about scene:
    By mouse:
