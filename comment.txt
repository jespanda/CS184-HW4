It was interesting to see how the order of tr, sc, and mv was crucial in
getting the correct image.

For example:
With tr * mv * sc : http://ec2-50-18-150-78.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/cs184web/hw2code/reports/cs184-ez/1348770487/index.html

and

with tr * sc * mv : http://ec2-50-18-150-78.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/cs184web/hw2code/reports/cs184-ez/1348768560/index.html

and 

with sc * tr * mv: http://ec2-50-18-150-78.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/cs184web/hw2/reports/cs184-ez/1348771065/
